<p>The Department of Physics at the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Medical Cyclotron Centre (Norsk medisinsk syklotronsenter AS) wants to produce radioisotopes for use in cancer diagnostics and treatment in a completely new way. &#8216;There is a significant shortage of radiogallium and other radioactive elements in the world, so it’s a question of how much we can produce rather than the size of the market,&#8217; says Bent Wilhelm Schoultz, nuclear chemist at the University of Oslo.</p>
<p>The chemist has had a busy week of travelling between the Department of Physics at Blindern and Uppsala in Sweden. There he has been granted access to a cyclotron belonging to GE Healthcare for the purpose of testing the new method of producing radiogallium.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with many of the above terms, do not despair; we will talk you through them. See also the facts box at the end of this article.</p>
<p>People suspected of having cancer can be injected with a radiopharmaceutical before undergoing a PET scan. The radiopharmaceutical usually consists of sugar and a fluorine radioisotope (fluorine-18). Since cancer cells are very fond of sugar, the radiopharmaceutical will accumulate in the cancerous parts of the body, so that these can be identified in a PET scan.</p>
<p>Medical imaging of the body using fluorine and certain other types of radioisotopes is carried out in more than 50 million cases every year. And while the need is growing, limited access to radioisotopes constitutes a bottleneck in the system.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Norwegian Medical Cyclotron Centre is a hybrid social impact and profit organisation. Our mandate is to secure good access to radiopharmaceuticals in Norway, while also making money. Excellent collaboration with the University of Oslo helps us realise these goals,&#8217; says Thor Audun Saga, managing director of the Cyclotron Centre.</p>
<p>The Cyclotron Centre funds an adjunct professor position in the Department of Physics, held by Gjermund Henriksen, research director at the Cyclotron Centre. Henriksen and Schoultz are a dynamic duo who have followed each other&#8217;s achievements for a long time and work closely together.</p>
<p>Remember Algeta, the company that developed the radiopharmaceutical Xofigo for cancer treatment from the research stage to a commercial product, and that in 2013 was acquired by Bayer for NOK 17.6 billion? Schoultz and Henriksen were Algeta&#8217;s first employees.</p>
<h2>To Sweden for a suitable cyclotron</h2>
<p>Radioisotope production is a demanding process, and this applies not least to radioactive fluorine used in PET scans. Radioisotopes can only be produced using a cyclotron, or particle accelerator, and the production of a single batch of the pharmaceutical requires approval from a number of people. That is why the University and the Cyclotron Centre&#8217;s researchers are exploring the possibility of also using other isotopes.</p>
<p>&#8216;In purely chemical, technical and administrative terms, the production of radiopharmaceuticals with fluorine-18 for use in human PET scans is demanding. Use of radiogallium instead of fluorine-18 will make the process less demanding, not least because the procedure for approval of the end product can be simplified on account of production being chemically less complex,&#8217; says nuclear chemist Bent Wilhelm Schoultz.</p>
<p>Radioisotopes can be produced on the basis of cyclotron or nuclear reactor technology. Gallium can be produced using generators based on cyclotron technology. Use of these generators is simple and they generate a certain small amount of gallium, but they quickly become less effective and in need of replacement. Furthermore, they are expensive and the delivery time is long. Henriksen and Schoultz are therefore developing technology for direct production of gallium using a cyclotron.</p>
<p>The production of other clinically important radioisotopes using nuclear reactors is under increasing pressure because many of these reactors are being decommissioned. That, together with a growing demand for radioisotopes, will increase the cyclotron&#8217;s importance as a production method for a number of radioisotopes.</p>
<p>The Department of Physics at the University of Oslo has a cyclotron at Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory; see the facts box. This is Norway&#8217;s first, and biggest, cyclotron, but Schoultz and Henriksen cannot use it for all the experiments they are conducting.</p>
<p>The Cyclotron Centre has another cyclotron, located at Rikshospitalet University Hospital. However, the latter is fully occupied producing radiopharmaceuticals based on fluorine-18, which are used for PET scans in hospitals all over Norway. Shift work is used to produce sufficient amounts, and use of the cyclotron for research purposes is thus not possible.</p>
<p>Thanks to the collaboration with GE Healthcare in Sweden on a FORNY project with funding from the Research Council of Norway, Schoultz is able to travel across the border almost all the way to the east coast of Sweden to the cyclotron in Uppsala. There, GE Healthcare manufactures cyclotrons for the global market, of various sizes and for various targets aimed at radioisotope production. A further explanation of what is meant by &#8216;target&#8217; will be given below, as it is key to understanding the research team&#8217;s innovations.</p>
<h2>Theranostics – an elegant combination of diagnostics and treatment</h2>
<p>The use of radiation to fight cancer is not new. Marie Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in both chemistry and physics for having discovered the radioactive element radium in 1898 together with her husband Pierre Curie. At the beginning of the 20th century, radium was already being used to treat cancer. The Norwegian Radium Hospital in Oslo was not completed until 1932, but its founders, Huitfeldt and Heyerdahl, started to prepare for its establishment in 1913 when they were given a small amount of radium by Ellen Gleditsch, a Norwegian researcher who spent five years working in Marie Curie&#8217;s laboratory.</p>
<p>New radioisotopes can revolutionise the way in which cancer is diagnosed and treated, and Schoultz considers gallium to be among the key elements in that connection.</p>
<p>&#8216;Theranostics is the term used to describe combined diagnostics and treatment. A pharmaceutical consisting of a cancer-seeking compound and gallium marks the cancer cells, which are imaged in a PET scan. By replacing gallium with another type of radioisotope, for example lutetium, internal radiotherapy can be performed in the exact location of the cancer, in one and the same process&#8217;, Schoultz tells us.</p>
<p>This means that a cancer patient, even if the cancer has spread to several organs, can be diagnosed and treated by simply alternating between two different radiometals. Furthermore, because the treatment is targeted, there will be fewer side effects.</p>
<p>Managing Director Thor Audun Saga of the Norwegian Cyclotron Centre also emphasises the theranostic possibilities associated with gallium.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is an elegant combination of diagnostics and treatment that will be increasingly used in the time ahead,&#8217; he says.</p>
<p>Schoultz points out that theranostics is not something new, or something that he and his colleagues have invented. However, little is happening in this field, and Schoultz thinks he knows why.</p>
<p>&#8216;The shortage of gallium puts brakes on theranostics. Up until recently, hospitals have had to wait 1 1/2 years for gallium generators whose efficacy is reduced by half in the course of only six months. Today, all the available gallium is used as it is very popular in clinical use. This has created a constant shortage of gallium on the market. The gallium generator is in high demand, even though it is expensive and not very effective,&#8217; explains Schoultz.</p>
<p>An important aspect of radiopharmaceuticals or short-lived radioisotopes used in medicine is the very fact that they are short-lived and disappear of their own accord. For example, the isotope gallium-68 has a half-life of little more than an hour.</p>
<h2>Multiple innovations and patents</h2>
<p>In order to increase the production of radioisotopes and gallium in particular, researchers at the Cyclotron Centre and the University of Oslo have developed a number of innovations. Three patent applications are currently based on their work.</p>
<p>A cyclotron can only be made to produce gallium if it is adapted for that particular type of isotope. That is why the researchers have developed a target holder and a ceramic target material. By &#8216;target&#8217; in this context is meant a form of target disc that is bombarded with nuclear particles, protons in our case, ejected from a particle accelerator. The protons react with the target material to form a gallium isotope. Very intense bombardment of a target material with nuclear particles can cause it to melt. The target holder is intended to protect the target material and cyclotron while this is taking place.</p>
<p>&#8216;This innovation enables us to produce large amounts of radiogallium in a central cyclotron, and then send it to where the patient is being treated. This means that hospitals do not need to have a generator or cyclotron for producing isotopes on site,&#8217; Schoultz tells us.</p>
<p>Saga believes that it will not necessarily take very long before radiogallium can be marketed as a replacement for fluorine-18.</p>
<p>&#8216;The best-case scenario will enable us to market cyclotron-produced radiogallium within three or four years. It will obviously depend on regulatory requirements, but we want to change production and produce more of the radiogallium that is already in use in clinical practice,&#8217; says Saga.</p>
<p>He points out that it is difficult to estimate the market and potential for sale of radiogallium, as current suppliers are naturally reluctant to reveal their cards.</p>
<p>&#8216;Gallium is both in great demand and very costly. A generator that produces two doses of gallium per day costs about NOK 600,000, so we find this market very interesting&#8217;, says Saga.</p>
<h2>2019 – a breakthrough year</h2>
<p>Schoultz and Henriksen appear to have attracted a lot of interest in 2019. So far they have gained support from the Research Council of Norway’s FORNY 2020 programme to verify that they <a href="https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/#/project/NFR/296700">can produce large enough amounts of gallium in a cyclotron</a>.</p>
<p>The duo have also been accepted by <a href="https://www.uio.no/forskning/satsinger/livsvitenskap/aktuelt/aktuelle-saker/2019/seks-nye-forskningsgrupper-klare-for-spark-norway.html">SPARK Norway together with five other research teams.</a> SPARK Norway is the University of Oslo&#8217;s innovation programme in the life science domain, under which the participants are offered support to further develop their ideas to the benefit of patients and society.</p>
<p>The researchers are also working to establish a platform for the development of other interesting radioisotopes, including technetium. To that end, they have been awarded an <a href="https://www.uio.no/for-ansatte/enhetssider/beskjed/2019/verifiseringsmidler-tildeling.html">innovation grant from the University of Oslo</a>. And, as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, the project is a core participant in an application to become a<a href="https://www.forskningsradet.no/om-forskningsradet/programmer/sfi/"> Centre for Research-driven Innovation</a>, to be submitted by the deadline in autumn 2019.</p>
<p>&#8216;Isotopes for Life&#8217; has been chosen as the working title for the Centre for Research-driven Innovation and partners in the project include the Norwegian Medical Cyclotron Centre, GE Healthcare, Bayer, the Institute for Energy Technology, Klydon, Oslo University Hospital, UC Berkeley in the USA and Stellenbosch University in South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have a number of assignments ready for large groups of both master and doctoral students, to further develop the work we have started. According to Schoultz, the students &#8216;will be given the possibility of bridging the gap between nuclear physics and cancer treatment, and between the theoretical and practical world’.</p>
<p>Grateful for Inven2</p>
<p>Technology Strategy Manager Elin Melby at Inven2 is working on a commercialisation strategy for the projects, addressing both licensing and possible company formation. Both the University of Oslo and the Cyclotron Centre are pleased with her work.</p>
<p>&#8216;Inven2 has put us in touch with industry and helped us gain support from the Research Council of Norway, which we would otherwise not have achieved. They place demands on us, thereby improving our strategies, our contact with potential customers and partners, and intellectual property rights relating to the projects,’ Schoultz tells us.</p>
<p>Saga at the Cyclotron Centre agrees with Schoultz and points out that, as a commercial company, they do not need to draw on the services of Inven2, but have chosen to do so nonetheless.</p>
<p>&#8216;Inven2 has extensive experience in patenting and contribute significantly on the commercialisation side. There, we are dealing with third parties in the form of large, global, commercial companies, and Inven2&#8217;s contribution is invaluable in that connection,&#8217; says Saga.</p>

<p><strong>Facts:</strong></p>
<p><u>PET scanning</u></p>
<p>PET is an acronym for positron-emission tomography. Images from PET scans will reveal accumulations of highly active cells, such as cancer cells.</p>
<p>Before the PET imaging test, a radiopharmaceutical is injected into a blood vein in the arm. The patient must then rest for an hour or so to give the pharmaceutical time to circulate. This is followed by an imaging test, which takes about 20 minutes. One such radiopharmaceutical is FDG, a material containing sugar and fluorine-18. Cancer cells attract sugar, whereby the pharmaceutical accumulates where there are cancer cells, and this will show up on the images and is thus expedient for distinguishing cancer cells from other cells. The radiopharmaceutical does not represent a high radiation dose.</p>
<p><u>PET is used for:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>diagnosing cancer;</li>
<li>distinguishing benign cellular changes from cancerous tumours;</li>
<li>assessing response to treatment through observing whether the tumorous tissue has shrunk, grown or remains unchanged;</li>
<li>distinguishing scar tissue following cancer operations from tumour recurrence;</li>
<li>assessing the extent of cancer;</li>
<li>looking into suspected spread of cancer.</li>

<p>For years, researchers at Oslo University Hospital and Akershus University Hospital have collaborated closely with the company NordicNeuroLab in Bergen to arrive at, develop and commercialise new and better diagnostic imaging methods. This has now resulted in a new product for advanced MR diagnostics that enables more targeted cancer treatment.</p>
<p>In March 2019, NordicNeuroLab was granted a new licence by Inven2 on behalf of Oslo University Hospital, Akershus University Hospital, NordicCAD AS, the clinician Kathrine Røe Redalen and MR physicists Kjell-Inge Gjesdal, Endre Grøvig and Tryggve Holck Storås.</p>
<p>The licence made it possible for <a href="https://www.nordicneurolab.com/en/">NordicNeuroLab</a> to develop a product for more advanced diagnostic MRI of cancerous tumours, which has already been launched on the international market. It can help oncologists to administer better and more targeted treatment, and monitor the effect of the treatment in a way that has not previously been possible.</p>
<p>‘It is particularly interesting to see physicists and clinicians working so closely together academically, and thereby contributing to an outcome that can be used by doctors in the treatment of patients in hospitals,&#8217; says Elin Melby. She is technology strategy manager in Inven2 and, along with colleague Kristin Sandereid, she has followed the projects closely for a number of years. Sandereid is responsible for the agreements with NordicNeuroLab.</p>
<p>‘The collaboration that has been established with NordicNeuroLab over the course of all these years is a fantastic example of a win-win relationship. The whole value chain, with Norwegian research, Norwegian clinicians and Norwegian industry, collaborates and creates results that lead to better products that are sold globally,&#8217; says Sandereid.</p>
<h2>New method of analysis</h2>
<p>Kjell-Inge Gjesdal works at Akershus University Hospital and played a central role in the development of the new method of analysing MR images, for which NordicNeuroLab has bought the licence.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have developed an imaging technique for evaluating cellular changes, regardless of whether they are benign or malignant, and then analysing the data. The technique is called “split-dynamics MRI” and has unique properties in that it provides an accurate image of the cancerous tumour at the same time as it reveals the condition of the cancer cells by means of a number of biomarkers,&#8217; Gjesdal explains, and he continues:</p>
<p>‘Patients to be diagnosed are injected with a contrast agent before the MR scan is carried out. On completion of the split-dynamics MRI we have two parallel image series – one consisting of many low-definition images and one consisting of high-definition images. The low-definition series lacks detail, but reflects the signal changes that take place inside the cancerous tumour when the contrast agent flows through it. The human eye or brain is unable to perceive such changes as they are very small and occur very rapidly,&#8217; says Gjesdal.</p>
<p>This MRI method generates enormous amounts of data, and Gjesdal and Grøvig, one of his doctoral students, realised that they needed special software to analyse the data.</p>
<p>That was when Atle Bjørnerud was drawn into the project. He has collaborated with NordicNeuroLab for a number of years and is a software development wizard.</p>
<p>&#8216;I started working with NordicNeuroLab back in 2003, and I played a central role in developing the software marketed by NordicNeuroLab under the name <a href="http://www.nordicneurolab.com/products/nordicICE.html">nordicICE</a>. Over the years, I have spent a lot of time on further developing that software,&#8217; says Atle Bjørnerud. NordicNeuroLab has launched several products on the market based on previous licences with Inven2 and Bjørnerud&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Bjørnerud is a physicist and in his day-to-day work he leads a research team in diagnostic imaging at Oslo University Hospital in addition to being part of the <a href="https://www.osloimtech.no/index.php">ImTech Centre</a>.</p>
<p>Funding from South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority made it possible to hire Bjørnerud to write the software code that has now been licensed by NordicNeuroLab.</p>
<h2>New market niche for NordicNeuroLab</h2>
<p>CEO Thomas Lie Omdahl of NordicNeuroLab is enthusiastic about the new licence.</p>
<p>&#8216;This looks very exciting. We are in the process of implementing the new software in nordicICE in order to test it prior to commercialisation. We are giving research teams with whom we collaborate the possibility to test the new application. They publish in scientific journals and, if the results live up to our expectations, it will be commercially available for use with our hardware and offered to Siemens and GE within two years,&#8217; says Lie Omdahl.</p>
<p>NordicNeuroLab was established in 2001 based on research from Haukeland University Hospital, and currently has 45 employees in Bergen, USA and Europe.</p>
<p>NordicNeuroLab has traditionally supplied diagnostic brain imaging services and been a leading supplier in that niche; they are now looking at cancer as an important target area for the future. This new product under the licence agreement with Inven2 is very well suited to the new target area.</p>
<h2>Invaluable help and support from Inven2</h2>
<p>Lie Omdahl, Bjørnerud and Gjesdal all commend the collaboration they enjoy with Inven2 and each other.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have drawn on the invaluable help and support of Inven2 in this project,&#8217; says Gjesdal, and Lie Omdahl supports this view:</p>
<p>&#8216;We have benefited from excellent collaboration with Inven2 and Atle Bjørnerud for many years. We are now witnessing more extensive use of nordicICE, not just on the brain, but also for prostate and breast imaging, and we look forward to extending our business in that direction in the time ahead.&#8217;</p>
<p>He points out that the collaboration with Inven2 is well-organised and professional, and that collaboration with the company has been a good experience up till now.</p>
<p>&#8216;Dialogue and negotiation of contracts that are mutually beneficial to all parties are important. We dare to go ahead because the initial costs are not too high, making commercialisation more effective and attractive,&#8217; says Lie Omdahl.</p>
<h2>Working with hospitals in Seoul</h2>
<p>The researchers initially focused on breast cancer and colon and rectal cancer, but news of the new analysis tool travelled fast, all the way to Korea, where researchers in Seoul are already involved in a collaboration with Akershus University Hospital and Oslo University Hospital on prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Lie Omdahl reports that many of the hospitals in Seoul are already using products from NordicNeuroLab, and that the research teams there are quick to adopt new technology.</p>
<p>&#8216;They have many patients in South Korea, so new technology can be validated quickly, which makes collaboration with South Korean researchers very attractive,&#8217; says Lie Omdahl.</p>
<p>The product was launched on the market in December.</p>

<p>Johanna Olweus is professor and director of both the K.G. Jebsen Centre for Cancer Immunotherapy and the Department of Cancer Immunology at the Institute for Cancer Research at the Norwegian Radium Hospital. The hospital&#8217;s new clinic is being erected outside her office window. Inside the building she and her team of 16 outstanding researchers are seeking to resolve a major problem in the field of immunotherapy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;Immunotherapy is the most important development in cancer treatment over the past 10–15 years. Many patients do not benefit from such treatment, however, and the majority are not cured by immunotherapy,&#8217; says Johanna Olweus from behind a large and seemingly untidy desk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appearances are not everything, however, and Olweus has full control of the documents on her desk. She and her team are doing a lot of innovative work, which is also reflected in a number of ongoing projects with Inven2. There is a lot of hard work going on in this office and the adjacent laboratory. Johanna is full of praise for her team.</p>
<p>‘They are an extremely capable lot,&#8217; she says.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ous-research.no/home/institute/Homepage%20news/19577">Olweus has recently been elected to the board of CIMT</a>, the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy. CIMT is Europe&#8217;s leading association of researchers seeking to fight cancer through immunotherapy. According to Olweus, international collaboration is important for ensuring a high standard of research and innovation.</p>
<p>&#8216;When we were awarded <a href="https://stiftkgj.no/hva-vi-gjor/k-g-jebsen-medisinske-sentre/k-g-jebsen-senter-for-immunterapi-mot-kreft/">K.G. Jebsen status</a> in 2013, we were granted permission by the Kristian Gerhard Jebsen Foundation to include an international partner, namely Ton Schumacher. He is one of the most world&#8217;s most sought-after researchers in the field of immunotherapy. Having him on the team meant that we could strengthen and develop our previous collaboration. According to Olweus, it is important for doctoral and post-doctoral students to gain insight into how research is conducted in other countries and to get an opportunity to work in the most excellent international laboratories.</p>
<p>The K.G. Jebsen Centre for Cancer Immunotherapy was one of few centres that was granted further funding by the foundation, and 2019 is the final year of funding.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN-GB">Affects the body&#8217;s own immune system</span></h2>
<p>Immunotherapy can most easily be explained as getting the body&#8217;s own immune system to identify and kill off cancer cells. Cancer cells can take on characteristics that enable them to go undetected by the body&#8217;s immune system. Cancer can thus spread without being detected.</p>
<p>&#8216;In immunotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T treatment have proved particularly effective. The checkpoint inhibitors remove the brakes in the immune system that prevent it from attacking cancer. With the aid of T cells, the immune system is then able to recognise and kill the cancer cells,&#8217; Olweus explains.</p>
<p>Today, approximately 40 per cent of cancer patients respond favourably to immunotherapy, but very few are completely cured.</p>
<p>&#8216;CAR-T is a more advanced treatment than checkpoint inhibitors. It involves genetic modification of T cells outside the patient&#8217;s body. The T cells are modified with an antibody that recognises a specific protein on the surface of, for example, the B cells in the immune system. In this way, CAR-T can kill some types of cancer, including leukaemia, in some adults and children,&#8217; says Olweus.</p>
<p>Unlike checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T can cure approximately 40 per cent of patients suffering from B cell leukaemia and B cell lymphoma. There was previously no hope for these patients.</p>
<p>However, CAR-T has clear limitations in relation to types of cancer that do not originate from B cells.</p>
<p>&#8216;CAR-T bonds with a surface protein on the B cell membrane. However, in its present form, the treatment does not distinguish between healthy cells and cancerous cells, but kills all B cells,&#8217; says Olweus.</p>
<p>That is not a problem, since we can get by without B cells. It is however a problem in relation to certain organs in the body.</p>
<p>‘There is a general need to be able to recognise other specific proteins in cancer cells and ideally also on the inside of the cells, since that is where most specific proteins are found. This will open up many more possibilities and will resolve a major problem in immunotherapy,&#8217; says Olweus.</p>
<p>And no sooner said than possibly done.</p>
<h2>Utilise a principle from transplant operations</h2>
<p>Olweus and her team are addressing this problem of proteins that have to be reached on the inside of the cells by using a principle taken from organ transplants.</p>
<p>&#8216;In connection with organ transplants, for example of a kidney, there are usually differences in tissue type between the donor and the recipient. This may not be a problem while the patient is taking immunosuppressants. But if the medication is stopped, the organ will quickly be rejected. In patients in whom an organ is transplanted that already has cancer, the cancer in that organ may also be rejected if immunosuppressants are no longer administered,&#8217; explains Olweus.</p>
<p>This rejection mechanism is due to the immune system in the organ recipient recognising the normal proteins when they are presented in the context of foreign tissue type molecules on the transplanted cells, and responding by initiating a vigorous immunologically conditioned rejection.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is this rejection mechanism we utilise to create new T cell receptors (TCR) to develop an immunotherapy that we hope will produce results in patients who are currently left with little hope of recovery,&#8217; says Olweus.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of using T cell receptors instead of antibodies as in CAR-T treatment, is that T cell receptors are capable of recognising proteins both on the surface and inside the cells.</p>
<p>‘This opens up entirely new possibilities for steering T cells towards their targets because we get many times as many targets to choose between,&#8217; says Olweus.</p>
<p>The technology developed by Olweus and her team is known as platform technology, and will be able to generate a series of new T cell receptors on the basis of that same principle. The technology has been patented, and the work on patenting and commercialisation has been carried out in collaboration with Inven2.</p>
<p>The researchers have now identified a number of T cell receptors that should be effective in the treatment of various forms of cancer. So far, the focus has been on some types of blood cancer for which there is currently no cure, in addition to some types of solid tumours.</p>
<h2>Great confidence in the technology</h2>
<p>The researchers have completed several pre-clinical trials on cells and test animals, with promising results. It remains to be seen, however, whether the principle will be equally effective in humans.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is really exciting to work with Johanna Olweus and her team. We are working on many of the spin-off projects from their research and are now looking at the possibility of establishing a company to commercialise the TCR technology they have developed. We have a lot of confidence in this project and we look forward to the work of setting up a company,&#8217; says Are Klevan.</p>
<p>Klevan works as a project manager in Inven2, and has teamed up with business developer Kristin Sandereid on this particular project.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 23.04px; color: #333333;">In need of infrastructure</span></p>
<p>Olweus is of the opinion that, while there are many good immunotherapy communities at Oslo University Hospital, the infrastructure is clearly lacking.</p>
<p>&#8216;If we are to keep abreast internationally, we must invest in infrastructure. We want to see a national immunogenic therapy centre being established, based in Oslo. This is a field in which therapeutic development is currently expensive and requires advanced equipment, but, looking forward, prices are expected to drop considerably, as they have done in the case of genetic sequencing,&#8217; says Olweus.</p>
<p>She dreams of establishing infrastructure of the kind that they have at the leading US universities and hospitals <a href="https://home.www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/u-s-news-world-report-names-msk-top-hospital-cancer-care?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrrXtBRCKARIsAMbU6bEDeDf2DQjK5AyJr90jUXdaiw42KFFG8Qh5nxl88NsSVa3FW22BcVgaAuSREALw_wcB">Memorial Sloan Kettering</a>, which lead the field globally in the development of new cancer treatments.</p>
<p>&#8216;Here, they have in-house access to everything, which makes an enormous difference. We currently have to wait a long time for technologies we need to work on things like virus production and transduction. We need to get this in place, or the opportunity will be lost,&#8217; says Olweus.</p>
<p>She is very grateful for the support and contributions received from the Research Council of Norway, Norwegian Cancer Society, South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority and Inven2, and she praises their willingness to invest in risky innovation projects like those that she and her team have been working on in recent years.</p>
<p>Olweus has led the work behind the research team&#8217;s publications in Science and the open-access journals at SpringerNature.com, whereby the research has been demonstrated to hold a high standard internationally.</p>
<p>And this has not gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>Olweus herself has started a prestigious collaboration with <a href="https://www.kitepharma.com/">Kite Pharma</a>/Gilead, one of the world&#8217;s leading companies in the development of immunotherapy. Olweus points out, however, that Oslo has several other skilled communities in the field of immunotherapy that have produced results of a high international standard.</p>
<p>&#8216;One good example is the work of Professor Kalle Malmberg, team leader at the Department of Cancer Immunology, who has just returned to the Institute for Cancer Research at the Norwegian Radium Hospital after spending a year at UC San Diego. Kalle has established extensive collaboration with <a href="https://fatetherapeutics.com/">Fate Therapeutics</a>, a world leader in biopharmaceuticals for cellular therapy, based in the USA. This illustrates that we are capable of making an international impact,&#8217; concludes Olweus.</p>
